<h3>💡 Fun Facts 💡 </h3>

-   Did you know that you can configure your browser settings to open mailto links *inside* your gmail account?

Some thoughtful people at the University of San Diego [outlined the steps for us ](https://usdkb.sandiego.edu/s/article/How-to-Open-Mailto-Links-in-Gmail#:~:text=Click%20the%203%20horizontal%20bars,change%20it%20to%20Use%20Gmail).

- San Diego is one of my favorite US cities.
